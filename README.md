### 1. What are the challenges I experienced in doing Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning 

I experienced several challenges while doing Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning. It was difficult to clean and organize the data properly, and sometimes I wasn’t sure which graphs or statistics were the most useful for understanding patterns. Interpreting p-values, correlations, and regression coefficients was also confusing at times, especially when the results didn’t match what I expected. In Machine Learning regression, I struggled with choosing the right model settings and understanding why the accuracy changed after training and testing.

### 2. What could have been the reasons why such an event happened? What are the things we have learned so that we can improve trom this experience?

These challenges happened mainly because I am still building my foundation in statistics, programming, and data interpretation. According to cognitive load theory, learning complex concepts at the same time can overwhelm the brain, which explains why some topics felt hard to grasp initially. Another reason is that data analysis requires both technical skills and critical thinking, and it takes practice to develop intuition for which methods work best. My limited experience with Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn also made the tasks feel more difficult. 

From this experience, I learned the importance of taking time to understand the data before running any analysis. I realized that data cleaning, proper visualization, and checking assumptions are essential steps that make the rest of the analysis easier. I also learned that interpreting results requires patience and practice, and it helps to review the basic statistical concepts behind each method. Using clear code, adding comments, and experimenting with different models all contribute to better understanding and confidence.

### 3. Now what do I need to do better next time?

Next time, I need to slow down and approach each step more systematically instead of rushing to produce results. I should review the statistical concepts before applying them, practice more with real datasets, and make sure I understand the purpose of each tool or technique I’m using. I also want to write cleaner, more organized code and use more comments to explain my thought process. Overall, I need to be more patient, more consistent with practice, and more intentional in how I analyze and interpret data.
